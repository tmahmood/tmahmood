# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- Making a quick launch application
- Writing blog about developing the quick launch application
- Client projects

Being lazy, I use Intellij to write my blogs

## You might find these projects interesting!

- [Taskwarrior Web](https://github.com/tmahmood/taskwarrior-web)
  - I should find a better name for this
  - It's a web-based UI, currently local only, for Task Warrior, a really powerful cli task management system
- [Table Map DB](https://github.com/tmahmood/table_map_db)
  - An embedded key-value storage implementation using rust+sqlite
  - It focuses on being reasonably fast, while being able to handle a large amount of dynamic data.
  - It uses optimized sqlite settings to get the best database performance
