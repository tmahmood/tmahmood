# Going back to iced, after my tauri journey

Tauri is nice, it's really easy to get started, but I feel,
iced deserves some attention, I have used it for a client in a previous project, and it worked pretty well.
It worked on both Linux and Windows, without any extra hassle.
Theming was a bit challenging, but I stole code from AirShipper and made my own. 

I switched to Tauri then because widget support is so much better, as it was simply HTML elements.

But now I am working on a small application,
  which is unlikely to have any complex user interactions, so, I am giving iced another try. 

So, here's day 1 of that journey!
